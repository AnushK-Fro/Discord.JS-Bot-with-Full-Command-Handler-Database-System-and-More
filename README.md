		 FroSkid is an open-source Discord.JS bot made for https://discord.me/HCHub. It comes with a full featured command handler along with
		 a warn system with support for multiple guilds. It also comes with a screenshot command that screenshots webpages. There are NSFW
		 commands but they are indeed optional. 
		 
		 Feel free to modify it or rename it for your personal Discord, just make sure to credit this github or Fro#7704.
		 This bot is made for beginners just like me.
		 
		 Special thanks to:
		 Whogivsachit - Most of the commands
		 OofsL - Slave/Test Subject
		 
		 How to install:
		 Press shift and right click at the same time.
		 Click open in powershell
		 Do npm install
		 Wait for that to finish
		 Go to settings.json and set your token and/or desired prefix
		 Then open the "Run Bot.bat"
		 Type "Y" and hit enter
		 
		 
		 I know there's other open source bots like Bastion or Xiao, but FroSkid is easy to use and you don't need to go through and
		 do a special installation process.
