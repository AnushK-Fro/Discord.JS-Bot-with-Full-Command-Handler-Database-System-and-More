		 FroSkid is an open-source Discord.JS bot made for https://discord.me/HCHub. It comes with a full featured command handler,
		 a full database system, music commands, and more! 
		 
		 Feel free to modify it or rename it for your personal Discord, just make sure to credit this github or Fro#7704.
		 This bot was made for beginners.
		 
		 Special thanks to:
		 Whogivsachit - Command Handler  /  Some Commands
		 OofsL - lol
		 
		 How to install:
		 Run the bot, for each module required open powershell and do "npm i <module name>"
		 Also, create a settings.json file with this in it:
		 {
			"ownerid": "PUT YOUR ID",
			"friendids": "FRIEND'S ID",
			"prefix": "-",
			"token": "INSERT TOKEN"
		}
		 Also be sure to create a folder called "images"
		 I know there's other open source bots like Bastion or Xiao, but FroSkid is easy to use bot and it isn't complicated.
